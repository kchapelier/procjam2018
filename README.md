# procjam2018

Project for Procjam 2018


## Potential use

 * Create procedural height maps for 3D applications.
 * Procedurally generate a full set of tilable textures (diffuse, normal maps, height maps, specular maps, ...) for 3D applications.
 * Generate tilable variations from a given tilable texture (works best with highdensity textures such as sand, gravels, dirt, ...)
 * Generate a tilable textures from a given non-tilable texture (works best with highdensity textures such as sand, gravels, dirt, ...)
 * Generate a normal map from a given image ([graph](http://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2018beta/?gist=https://gist.github.com/kchapelier/f0e5741103160c1f7f89b8eb4a14e1a1)).
 * Combine multiple b/w maps in a single image ([graph](http://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2018beta/?gist=https://gist.github.com/kchapelier/c8cc088bdca781c421666656e0ea6723))
 * Create complex custom effects to apply to images.
 * Usable as a prototyping tool for creative coding, without the coding ([example](https://twitter.com/kchplr/status/1058008232063627266), [graph](http://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2018beta/?gist=https://gist.github.com/kchapelier/5a4648b643c914d676f6f62891cd2407))
 * Generate black and white maps to use in page transitions in websites ([example](https://twitter.com/kchplr/status/1061616749697744896), [graph](http://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2018beta/?gist=http://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2018beta/?gist=https://gist.github.com/kchapelier/be0b5de96b712fddcdf6d912078394ef)).

## Restrictions

 * The application is only supported on Firefox and Chrome as it depends on multiple modern API not available yet on other browsers.
 * The tool only deals with square textures. There is no plan to support the generation of non square textures.
 * The tool can currently only generate textures of 1024x1024 pixels.
 * The color control are currently rather limited, gradient maps have to be provided by the user.
